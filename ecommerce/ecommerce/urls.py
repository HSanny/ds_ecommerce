    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path

"""
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    
    # This is your projectâ€™s main URL configuration. 
    # The include() function allows you to reference the urls.py of your products app. When a user navigates to /products/, Django will look for further URL patterns defined in products.urls. 
    # This makes URL management scalable and tidy.

    
    path(
        "products/",
        include("products.urls")
    )
